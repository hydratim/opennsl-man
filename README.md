# opennsl-man
Opennsl-man is a simple management interface for OpenNSL compatible switches.
The goal is that it should implement most of the features that you'd expect in a regular L2 switch.

## Motivation
I'm picking up where Ishida Wataru left off with Opennsl-server, and implementing the missing core features as a way to learn OpenNSL and simultaneously build a usefull tool. At some stage I'll pull out the Go lang stuff, instead favouring either python3 or pure C++ (as I know them far better than I know Go) and migrate to a RESTfull API rather than gRPC.
